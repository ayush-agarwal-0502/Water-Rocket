This repository is a description of the water rocket I built for Liftoff Competition held in National Students Space Challenge (NSSC) , held in IIT Kharagpur . Although we did not win , but it was my first outfest , and I had a great amount of learnings from this event , both in technical , hardware , as well as management terms .

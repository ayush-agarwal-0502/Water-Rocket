This repository is a description of the water rocket I built for Liftoff Competition held in National Students Space Challenge (NSSC) , held in IIT Kharagpur . Although we did not win , but it was my first outfest , and I had a great amount of learnings from this event , both in technical , hardware , as well as management terms . Our rocket managed to reach a range of about 25 meters , as compared to the range of 5m achieved when a simple plastic bottle is launched , thus being 400% better .

## The Launcher :

Cycle pump has been used for the pressurising mechanism . The launcher has been built out of engineering materials such as wood , pipes etc . Its structure is as visible in the pictures . The locking mechanism is same as all standard water rocket launchers as seen in the picture . 

## The Rocket :

* Since the ideal shape of rocket nose must be parabolic ( and not pointed as a common man might believe ) , we used plastic balls to improve the aerodynamicity of the nose . 
* Glider wings have been attached so that we could achieve more range during the flight of the rocket , as the wings would avoid an immidiate fall and keep producing lift . However , care has been taken to avoid excessive size , so as to avoid drag . 
* Since the glider model would twist and go unstable during the flight , hence a stabiliser wing is needed to stabilise the turning effect . 
* Since there was a curve in the bottle we were using , which would cause vortices and slow down the rocket , hence ring has been added made using newspapers and tape . 
* Some tape was added along with the hot glue gun glue , to add supportive strength to the structure .
